This is the salt that is prepended to user passwords server-side to mitigate the
effectiveness of rainbow tables.

It is EXTREMELY important that this file not be distributed or visible to the
public, since the rest of system is open-source and this file is the only thing
preventing someone from setting up a massive offline attack on hashed user
passwords.

Of course, they'd need to get the user passwords from the database first,
but assuming that that is compromised, that isn't completely hard to fathom
(directory-wide permissions/htaccess mishap could do it).

Anyway, the top line here should be something quite long (64+ or so chars)
and consist of fairly entropic data (grc's generator is a good one).
