If you add a new module, please do the following in order to make sure it works:

(1) Extend module.php's base class
(2) Implement the content-providing method
(3) Add your module file to session.php in /php

That's all! (Unless you're extending a module _other than_ the base module, in
which case, look at the note in /php/imports.php. Not that you should be doing
that...)
